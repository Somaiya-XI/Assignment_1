# Assignment 1: Frequent Patterns Problem

This project contains a Python code that implements an algorithm to find the most frequent pattern occurrence in a text sequence.

It takes 2 inputs: text sequence & the value of k, which represents the pattern length.

The program then provides the most frequent patterns of length k in the given text sequence.
