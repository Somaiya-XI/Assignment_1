# Assignment 1: Frequent Patterns Problem

This project contains a Python code that implements an algorithm to find the most frequent pattern occurrence in a text sequence.

It takes 2 inputs: text sequence & the value of k, which represents the pattern length.

The program then provides the most frequent patterns of length k in the given text sequence.


## Usage

To run the code, you need to have Python-3.11 installed on your system. Follow the following steps:

1. Download the attatched ZIP file or Clone the repository to your machine using the following command:

```bash

   git clone https://github.com/Somaiya-XI/Assignment_1.git

```

   
2. Open Assignment_1 or Navigate to the project directory using the following command:
   
```bash

   cd Assignment_1

```

3. Run the program by executing the Python script using terminal:

```bash

    python frequentWordsProblem.py

```

NOTE: You might easily run it using your prefered IDE as well. e.g., VS Code, PyCharm
